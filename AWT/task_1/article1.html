            Formula 1 drivers are outstanding athletes, combining physical
            endurance with mental fortitude. They undergo years of preparation
            that start from junior karting to high-tech simulator sessions in
            top teams. Training focuses not just on cardiovascular fitness and
            neck strength to withstand forces over 5 Gs, but also on mental
            resilience necessary to stay focused during fast, high-pressure
            races lasting up to two hours.

            Drivers rely on advanced coaching and a support team including race
            engineers, fitness trainers, nutritionists, and sports
            psychologists. Their preparation includes daily simulator practice,
            reaction time training, and cognitive drills to sharpen
            decision-making. Drivers must master complex telemetry systems and
            rapidly interpret data from the car during races, making
            split-second strategic decisions that can greatly influence race
            outcomes.

            During tight corners, Formula 1 drivers experience forces exceeding
            5 Gs — about five times the force of gravity!
