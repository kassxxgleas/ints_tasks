            <h2>F1 Basics</h2>
            <p>
              Formula 1, often abbreviated as F1, is the highest class of
              international auto racing for single-seater formula racing cars.
              Motor racing evolved significantly after World War II, becoming
              more structured and leading to the establishment of Formula One as
              the premier category in auto racing.
            </p>
            <p>
              It involves teams competing in a series of Grand Prix events held
              on purpose-built circuits and public roads. The “Formula” in the
              name refers to a set of rules that all participants must follow
              when designing and building their cars.

            <h2>Singapore GP: Five quick takeaways</h2>
            <p>
              McLaren's intra-team title battle may have been a friendly affair
              so far, with some pushing and pulling between its two drivers and
              their team. But the Singapore race was the first indication of
              tension between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Piastri didn't take kindly to Norris "barging" into him at the
              start, as the Briton made up two spots and snatched third away
              from the Australian. Norris was about to pass Piastri fairly on
              the inside, but then had to duck out of the way for Max Verstappen
              who was slower than expected on the apex.
