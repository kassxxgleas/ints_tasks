    <h1>Japanese cuisine: recipes and gastronomic traditions</h1>
    <p>
      Traditional Japanese cuisine is characterized by simplicity, fresh
      ingredients, and harmony of flavors. Main dishes include sushi, ramen,
      soba, udon, okonomiyaki, and tempura.

      Each of these dishes has its own unique history and preparation methods
      that reflect Japan's cultural norms and traditions. For example, sushi
      symbolizes harmony and aesthetics, while ramen is a popular street food
      with many regional variations. The seasonality of ingredients also plays
      an important role, making Japanese cuisine healthy and balanced.
